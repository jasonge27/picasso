Description: Computationally efficient tools for fitting sparse generalized linear
    models with convex or nonconvex penalties. Supported penalties include lasso,
    smoothly clipped absolute deviation, and minimax concave penalty. Computation
    is based on multi-stage convex relaxation and a path algorithm with warm
    starts, active-set updates, and screening rules. The implementation uses C++
    and provides sparse outputs for memory efficiency.
